# QA system
The data folder contains the orignial data set training.json, development.json and testing.json. The POS tags and NER tags were trained from Stanford CoreNLP API and were stored in json files named dev_coreNLP.json and test_coreNLP.json. When running the program, only these json files will be read from the data folder and the CoreNLP won't be sourced.

Results of prediction answers were stored in result folder.


folder trees should be like:
proj3:
	src
		./proj3_p2_v1.1.py
	data
		training.json
		development.json
		testing.json
		dev_coreNLP.json
		test_coreNLP.json
	result 
		submission.csv

Run:
	python ./src/proj3_p2_v1.1.py


Keep load_word.py in the same folder
Run: 
lstm_ptr.py
